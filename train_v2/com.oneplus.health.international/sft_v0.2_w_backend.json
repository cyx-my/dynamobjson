/><我们可能会委托我们的关联公司或合作的其他第三方代表我们来处理信息，以便为您提供更好的产品/服务，改善您的用户体验。例如我们的物流供应商、云服务提供商、数据存储设施、客户服务供应商、广告和营销服务供应商以及其他专业服务提供商为我们提供技术支持服务、客户支持服务等。 /><对于委托处理个人信息的场景，我们会根据法律法规规定通过书面协议、现场审计等方式要求受托合作方（公司、组织和个人）遵守严格的保密义务并采取有效的保密措施，要求其只能代表我们并根据我们的指示在委托范围内处理您的信息，而不得出于其自身利益使用您的信息。书面协议中会严格约定委托处理的目的、期限、处理方式、个人信息的种类、保护措施以及双方的权利和义务等，并对受托人的个人信息处理活动进行监督。 /><2、 共享信息 /><我们可能会与关联公司、合作伙伴等第三方共享您的个人信息，以便为了向您提供更完善、优质的产品/服务。在共享的场景下，双方分别对个人信息拥有独立控制权。我们仅会出于合法、正当、必要、特定、明确的目的共享您的个人信息，只会共享提供服务所必要的个人信息，并且将在法律法规明确要求下取得您的单独同意。相关第三方无权将共享的个人信息用于任何其他用途。我们会与第三方合作方签署数据保护协议，要求他们采取相关的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息，明确合作方对您的个人信息的保护责任和义务。 /><如果您拒绝我们的关联公司、合作方在提供服务时收集、使用为提供特定产品/服务所必需的个人信息，将可能导致您无法使用相关产品/服务中由该关联公司、合作方提供的部分。 /><除以下情形外和本政策另有约定外，我们不会与任何第三方共享您的个人信息： /><（1） 与关联公司的共享 /><为了向您提供更为完善和丰富的产品/服务，我们可能通过接口或线下传输不时向我们的关联公司合法共享必要的个人信息。我们只会共享必要的个人信息，且受本政策中声明目的的约束。 /><（2） 为实现产品/服务的功能向第三方服务提供商的共享 /><我们的产品/服务中部分服务内容由第三方服务提供商提供。为向您提供您选择的功能/服务，我们需要向第三方共享必要的个人信息。 /><针对特定产品/服务，您可以通过访问其项下的《第三方信息共享清单》详细了解我们在特定产品/服务中向第三方服务提供商共享个人信息的情况。 /><（3） 我们与第三方软件开发包（SDK）服务商的合作 /><我们提供的产品/服务中可能包含我们授权的合作伙伴提供的SDK插件。当您在特定产品/服务中使用该授权合作伙伴提供的相关服务，相关服务插件将收集和处理您的相关个人信息。为了最大程度保障您的信息安全，我们建议您在使用任何第三方SDK类服务前先行查看其隐私条款。为保障您的合法权益，如您发现这等SDK或其他类似的应用程序存在风险时，建议您立即终止相关操作并及时与我们取得联系。 /><您可以通过访问特定产品/服务项下的《第三方信息共享清单》以进一步了解我特定产品/服务中使用第三方SDK的情况。 /><（4） 其他信息共享场景 /><根据法律法规规定要求、法律程序、诉讼和/或公共机构和政府部门依法提出的要求，我们可能会在最小必要的范围内在下述情况中共享您的个人信息： /><●  遵守传票或其他法律程序、法律行动或政府机构的要求； /><●  当我们真诚地认为披露是遵守法律和执法部门的合理要求所必需时； /><●  保护和行使我们的合法索赔、权利和财产； /><●  保护您或他人的权利、财产或个人安全； /><●  检测、预防、调查并解决欺诈行为；以及 /><●  保护我们服务的安全或完整性，例如产品的未授权使用，对我们条款或政策的违反或其他有害或非法活动。 /><如果我们确定为了保护用户，或对于达成以上目的披露是合理必要的，我们也可能会披露关于您的信息。为避免疑问，在当地数据保护法律明确许可的范围内且仅限符合上述情况，我们才会在未经您同意的情况下收集、使用或共享您的个人信息。这可能包括向公共或政府机构提供信息、与第三方合作伙伴共享您的个人信息，以防止在我们产品内外所进行的欺诈、违规等其他有害行为。 /><3、 转让 /><我们不会将您的个人信息转让给任何公司、组织和个人，但以下情况除外： /><●  经您主动请求且符合国家有关部门规定的条件时，我们会向其他方转让转移您的个人信息； /><●  根据适用的法律法规、法律程序的要求、强制性的行政或司法要求所必需的情况进行提供； /><●  商业交易中如涉及合并、收购或破产清算或类似活动时，如涉及个人信息转让，我们会在有限但必要的范围内向适用的第三方转移或披露您的个人信息，并要求新的持有您个人信息的公司、组织继续受本政策的约束，否则我们将要求该公司、组织重新向您征求授权同意。如果不涉及个人信息转让，我们会对您进行充分告知，并将我们控制的所有个人信息删除或做匿名化处理。我们会通过协议或其他适当措施，要求上述第三方采取相当的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息。 /><4、 公开披露 /><我们仅会在以下情况下，公开披露您的个人信息： /><●  获得您的单独同意后，按您同意的披露方式披露您所指定的个人信息； /><●  在法律、法律程序、诉讼或政府主管部门强制性要求的情况下，我们可能会公开披露您的个人信息。在符合法律法规的前提下，当我们收到上述披露信息的请求时，我们会要求必须出具与之相应的法律文件，如传票或调查函。我们坚信，对于要求我们提供的信息，应该在法律允许的范围内尽可能保持透明。我们对所有的请求都进行了慎重的审查，以确保其具备合法依据，且仅限于执法部门因特定调查目的且有合法权利获取的数据。 /><在公布促销、比赛、抽奖结果等营销、运营推广相关活动中，我们会脱敏展示中奖者帐号名称、手机号码等信息。 /><请注意：您在使用相关产品/服务自愿发布甚至公开分享的信息，例如社交媒体帐号、平台等，可能会涉及您或他人的个人信息甚至敏感个人信息，如您的交易信息、联系方式、家庭住址，以及您在评价时选择上传包含个人信息的文字、图片或视频各种形式的信息。请您在使用相关产品/服务时更加谨慎地考虑，是否要发布甚至公开分享相关信息。一旦您进行了此等共享，即使您在相关产品/服务中删除了相关信息，也很难确保您所共享的信息在所有接受转发的产品/服务中被全部删除，相关信息仍然可能留存在公众可获知的领域，仍可由其他用户、与我们没有关联不受我们控制的第三方独立地缓存、复制或存储，或通过其他用户或相关第三方在公众可获知的领域保存。 /><六、 我们如何保护您的个人信息 /><1、 我们采取的安全保护措施 /><我们非常重视个人信息的安全，我们采取了合理可行的技术安全和组织措施，以保护所收集到的与服务有关的个人信息，防止个人信息遭到未经授权的访问、公开披露、使用、修改、损坏或丢失。我们会采取一切合理可行的措施，保护您的个人信息，主要包括： /><（1） 我们使用 SSL/TLS等主流安全技术手段对许多服务以及传输通道进行加密。我们会定期审查信息收集、存储和处理方面的做法（包括物理性安全措施），以避免各种系统遭到未经授权的访问或篡改。 /><（2） 根据有关法规要求，我们任命了个人信息保护负责人并成立了个人信息保护工作机构。我们还建立了相关的内控管理流程，以最小授权为原则，我们对个人信息的访问进行严格的权限管控，只允许那些为了帮我们处理个人信息而需要知晓这些信息的我们的员工、授权代为处理的服务公司的人员访问个人信息，而且他们需要履行严格的合同保密义务，如果其未能履行这些义务，就可能会被追究法律责任或被终止其与我们的关系。个人数据的访问日志将被记录，并定期审计。针对需要访问敏感个人信息的员工，其访问权限由个人信息保护负责人或者相关管理人员审批，记录访问情况，并采取技术措施，避免违法访问、修改、复制、下载个人信息。 /><（3） 对我们来说，您的信息的安全非常重要。因此，我们将不断努力保障您的个人信息安全，并实施存储和传输全程安全加密等保障手段，以免您的信息在未经授权的情况下被访问、使用或披露。同时，某些加密数据的具体内容，除了用户自己，其他人都无权访问。 /><（4） 我们在传输和存储您的敏感个人信息或其他特殊类型个人信息时，会采用加密等安全措施；存储个人生物识别信息时，将采用技术措施处理后再进行存储，例如仅存储个人生物识别信息的摘要。 /><（5） 我们会严格筛选业务合作伙伴和服务提供商，将在个人信息保护方面的要求落实到双方的商务合同或审计、考核等活动中。 /><（6） 公司内部颁布实施数据安全管理规范，明确对用户数据（包括用户个人信息）的保护标准和要求。 /><（7） 我们会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程、测试与宣传活动，加强员工对于保护个人信息重要性的认识。 /><（8） 我们采用国际及业内认可的标准来保护您的个人信息，并积极通过相关安全与隐私保护认证，并与监管方、第三方安全服务提供商、测评认证机构建立良好的协调沟通机制，及时抵御并处置信息安全威胁，保护您的个人信息及隐私安全。 /><2、 个人信息安全事件的通知与应对 /><但是请注意，虽然我们采取了合理的措施保护您的信息，但没有任何网站、Internet 传输、计算机系统或无线连接是绝对安全的。 /><在发生个人信息安全事件后，我们将按照相关法律法规的要求，及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。我们将及时将事件相关情况以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式告知您。难以逐一告知个人信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报个人信息安全事件的处置情况，并采取措施降低由此产生的任何风险。 /><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份；不同的产品/服务、操作系统、产品软件的不同版本之间，操作设置可能存在差异；此外，为了优化您的使用体验，我们可能对具体操作设置进行调整。 /><您对您个人信息享有的权利如下： /><1、 查阅、更正、补充您的个人信息 /><(1) 查阅：您有权了解、查阅我们如何处理您的个人信息，以及您对您的个人信息有哪些选择和权利。为提高个人信息处理的透明度，我们发布了本政策，在特定的产品/服务中，您也可以通过查看相关产品/服务的弹窗、声明、补充政策。 /><(2) 更正、补充：如果您发现我们处理的关于您的个人信息不准确或不完整，您有权要求我们及时纠正，并在适当的情况下要求我们完成修正您的个人信息。对于您的部分个人信息，您可以在特定产品/服务的相关功能页面直接进行更正、修改。为了保证个人信息的质量，避免因个人信息不准确、不完整对您的个人权益造成不利影响，我们可能需要在您行使更正权、补充权前，对您的身份进行必要的核实工作。 /><2、 删除您的个人信息 /><有如下情形之一的，我们将主动删除您的个人信息，或您可以向我们提出删除请求： /><●  处理目的已实现、无法实现或者为实现处理目的不再必要； /><●  我们停止提供产品/服务，或者保存期限已届满，例如您已经不再使用我们的产品/服务； /><●  您已经撤回同意； /><●  我们违反法律、行政法规或者违反约定处理您的个人信息； /><●  法律、行政法规规定的其他情形。 /><另外，在特定的产品/服务中，您可以在相关功能页面直接删除。 /><我们将根据国家法律法规及监管的要求决定是否响应您的请求，若我们决定响应您的删除请求，除非法律法规或规范性文件另有规定，您的个人信息将被删除或匿名化处理。同时，我们还将通知从我们获得您的个人信息的实体，要求其及时删除或对相关个人信息做匿名化处理，除非法律法规另有规定，或这些实体获得您的独立授权。 /><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利 /><如用户不幸逝世，在该用户生前未通过书面或者其他合理方式向我们告知另有安排的前提下，该用户的近亲属可基于自身的合法、正当利益，与我们联系，以获取相关指引来行使法律规定的查阅、复制、更正、删除等权利。 /><7、 其他 /><退出用户体验计划：您可以随时通过设备的设置管理选择退出用户体验计划。在您选择退出该计划后，我们将不再收集、处理从您的设备上收集到的该计划的所有数据。 /><约束信息系统自动决策：在某些产品/服务中，我们可能依据信息系统、算法等在内的非人工自动决策机制作出决定。如果这些决定显著影响您的合法权益，您可以联系我们。 /><退订营销、推送服务：如果您不希望再收到营销、推送信息，您可以随时通过每条促销短信、邮件中所述的方法或更改设备设置等方式来管理相关服务。 /><8、 响应您的上述请求 /><（1） 响应方式 /><您可以通过以下方式进行相应的隐私设置： /><●  在设备设置中管理用户体验计划、稳定性计划、个性化推荐等； /><●  在设备设置中管理权限； /><●  在各个产品/服务中进行开启/关闭相应功能，通过点击“撤回个人信息保护政策的同意”进行个人信息保护政策管理 /><您可以通过以下方式与我们取得联系： /><●  通过本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式联系我们。 /><如您对您的个人信息主体权利存在任何疑问、意见或建议的，或者要求我们对本政策进行解释说明，可以与我们取得联系。我们将及时向您进行解释。如果您对收到的答复不满意，您有权将投诉提交至相关监管部门。 /><（2） 响应时间 /><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><1、 存储地点 /><我们依照法律法规的规定，将在中华人民共和国大陆地区（以下简称“境内”）运营过程中收集和产生的您的个人信息存储于境内的服务器。仅在以下情形，且在满足法律法规及监管部门的相关规定后，我们可能会向境外主体提供您的个人信息：（1）法律法规有明确规定；（2）另行获得您单独同意；（3）您使用的产品与/或服务本身涉及跨境，且您主动向境外提供个人信息。我们将严格要求接收方按照相关法律法规要求及本政策来处理您的个人信息 /><当满足上述向境外主体提供个人信息的条件后，我们将在个人信息跨境转移之前采取充分的安全措施（如加密、去标识化等），确保我们收集的个人信息按照本政策并遵守在该国家或地区当地存储数据的法律，以最终确保您的个人信息得到充分的保护。 /><2、 存储时间 /><除非法律要求或您另行授权同意更长的保存期限，否则我们只会在为您提供产品/服务之目的必需的最短时间内存储您的个人信息。在您主动要求相关产品/服务删除个人信息或相关产品/服务收集、使用的个人信息超出必要的存储期限后，我们会根据法律法规要求尽快对您的个人信息进行删除或匿名化处理，但法律法规另有规定的除外。如果法律要求我们存储您的个人信息超过这个期限，我们将在法律要求的期限结束后删除或匿名化该个人信息。 /><我们判断个人信息的必要存储期限主要依据以下标准：（1）处理个人信息的目的：个人信息处理所对应的业务目的是否已经或者无法实现，或者个人信息处理活动是否因业务变更、终止等原因而不再必要；（2）个人信息的数量、性质和敏感程度；（3）未经授权使用和披露您的个人信息所带来的潜在风险；（4）维护相应交易及业务记录，以应对您可能的查询或投诉；（3）保证我们为您提供服务的安全和质量；（4）法律或者行政法规对个人信息的保存期限另有规定。 /><如您在使用相关产品/服务过程中，存在严重违反法律法规、产品/服务协议、政策或规则等情形，您的违法、违约记录及相应的信用记录、个人信息，将在法律允许的最大范围内进行保存。 /><在我们因特殊原因停止运营我们的部分或全部产品/服务时，我们会提前向您告知并停止相关产品/服务的个人信息收集和处理活动，并在满足法律法规规定的最短保存期内，将我们所持有的与该产品/服务相关的个人信息进行删除或匿名化处理，除非法律法规另有规定。 /><五、 我们如何委托处理、共享、转让、公开披露您的个人信息 /><1、 委托处理 /><我们可能会委托我们的关联公司或合作的其他第三方代表我们来处理信息，以便为您提供更好的产品/服务，改善您的用户体验。例如我们的物流供应商、云服务提供商、数据存储设施、客户服务供应商、广告和营销服务供应商以及其他专业服务提供商为我们提供技术支持服务、客户支持服务等。 /><对于委托处理个人信息的场景，我们会根据法律法规规定通过书面协议、现场审计等方式要求受托合作方（公司、组织和个人）遵守严格的保密义务并采取有效的保密措施，要求其只能代表我们并根据我们的指示在委托范围内处理您的信息，而不得出于其自身利益使用您的信息。书面协议中会严格约定委托处理的目的、期限、处理方式、个人信息的种类、保护措施以及双方的权利和义务等，并对受托人的个人信息处理活动进行监督。 /><2、 共享信息 /><我们可能会与关联公司、合作伙伴等第三方共享您的个人信息，以便为了向您提供更完善、优质的产品/服务。在共享的场景下，双方分别对个人信息拥有独立控制权。我们仅会出于合法、正当、必要、特定、明确的目的共享您的个人信息，只会共享提供服务所必要的个人信息，并且将在法律法规明确要求下取得您的单独同意。相关第三方无权将共享的个人信息用于任何其他用途。我们会与第三方合作方签署数据保护协议，要求他们采取相关的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息，明确合作方对您的个人信息的保护责任和义务。 /><如果您拒绝我们的关联公司、合作方在提供服务时收集、使用为提供特定产品/服务所必需的个人信息，将可能导致您无法使用相关产品/服务中由该关联公司、合作方提供的部分。 /><除以下情形外和本政策另有约定外，我们不会与任何第三方共享您的个人信息： /><（1） 与关联公司的共享 /><为了向您提供更为完善和丰富的产品/服务，我们可能通过接口或线下传输不时向我们的关联公司合法共享必要的个人信息。我们只会共享必要的个人信息，且受本政策中声明目的的约束。 /><（2） 为实现产品/服务的功能向第三方服务提供商的共享 /><我们的产品/服务中部分服务内容由第三方服务提供商提供。为向您提供您选择的功能/服务，我们需要向第三方共享必要的个人信息。 /><针对特定产品/服务，您可以通过访问其项下的《第三方信息共享清单》详细了解我们在特定产品/服务中向第三方服务提供商共享个人信息的情况。 /><（3） 我们与第三方软件开发包（SDK）服务商的合作 /><我们提供的产品/服务中可能包含我们授权的合作伙伴提供的SDK插件。当您在特定产品/服务中使用该授权合作伙伴提供的相关服务，相关服务插件将收集和处理您的相关个人信息。为了最大程度保障您的信息安全，我们建议您在使用任何第三方SDK类服务前先行查看其隐私条款。为保障您的合法权益，如您发现这等SDK或其他类似的应用程序存在风险时，建议您立即终止相关操作并及时与我们取得联系。 /><您可以通过访问特定产品/服务项下的《第三方信息共享清单》以进一步了解我特定产品/服务中使用第三方SDK的情况。 /><（4） 其他信息共享场景 /><根据法律法规规定要求、法律程序、诉讼和/或公共机构和政府部门依法提出的要求，我们可能会在最小必要的范围内在下述情况中共享您的个人信息： /><●  遵守传票或其他法律程序、法律行动或政府机构的要求； /><●  当我们真诚地认为披露是遵守法律和执法部门的合理要求所必需时； /><●  保护和行使我们的合法索赔、权利和财产； /><●  保护您或他人的权利、财产或个人安全； /><●  检测、预防、调查并解决欺诈行为；以及 /><●  保护我们服务的安全或完整性，例如产品的未授权使用，对我们条款或政策的违反或其他有害或非法活动。 /><如果我们确定为了保护用户，或对于达成以上目的披露是合理必要的，我们也可能会披露关于您的信息。为避免疑问，在当地数据保护法律明确许可的范围内且仅限符合上述情况，我们才会在未经您同意的情况下收集、使用或共享您的个人信息。这可能包括向公共或政府机构提供信息、与第三方合作伙伴共享您的个人信息，以防止在我们产品内外所进行的欺诈、违规等其他有害行为。 /><3、 转让 /><我们不会将您的个人信息转让给任何公司、组织和个人，但以下情况除外： /><●  经您主动请求且符合国家有关部门规定的条件时，我们会向其他方转让转移您的个人信息； /><●  根据适用的法律法规、法律程序的要求、强制性的行政或司法要求所必需的情况进行提供； /><●  商业交易中如涉及合并、收购或破产清算或类似活动时，如涉及个人信息转让，我们会在有限但必要的范围内向适用的第三方转移或披露您的个人信息，并要求新的持有您个人信息的公司、组织继续受本政策的约束，否则我们将要求该公司、组织重新向您征求授权同意。如果不涉及个人信息转让，我们会对您进行充分告知，并将我们控制的所有个人信息删除或做匿名化处理。我们会通过协议或其他适当措施，要求上述第三方采取相当的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息。 /><4、 公开披露 /><我们仅会在以下情况下，公开披露您的个人信息： /><●  获得您的单独同意后，按您同意的披露方式披露您所指定的个人信息； /><●  在法律、法律程序、诉讼或政府主管部门强制性要求的情况下，我们可能会公开披露您的个人信息。在符合法律法规的前提下，当我们收到上述披露信息的请求时，我们会要求必须出具与之相应的法律文件，如传票或调查函。我们坚信，对于要求我们提供的信息，应该在法律允许的范围内尽可能保持透明。我们对所有的请求都进行了慎重的审查，以确保其具备合法依据，且仅限于执法部门因特定调查目的且有合法权利获取的数据。 /><在公布促销、比赛、抽奖结果等营销、运营推广相关活动中，我们会脱敏展示中奖者帐号名称、手机号码等信息。 /><请注意：您在使用相关产品/服务自愿发布甚至公开分享的信息，例如社交媒体帐号、平台等，可能会涉及您或他人的个人信息甚至敏感个人信息，如您的交易信息、联系方式、家庭住址，以及您在评价时选择上传包含个人信息的文字、图片或视频各种形式的信息。请您在使用相关产品/服务时更加谨慎地考虑，是否要发布甚至公开分享相关信息。一旦您进行了此等共享，即使您在相关产品/服务中删除了相关信息，也很难确保您所共享的信息在所有接受转发的产品/服务中被全部删除，相关信息仍然可能留存在公众可获知的领域，仍可由其他用户、与我们没有关联不受我们控制的第三方独立地缓存、复制或存储，或通过其他用户或相关第三方在公众可获知的领域保存。 /><六、 我们如何保护您的个人信息 /><1、 我们采取的安全保护措施 /><我们非常重视个人信息的安全，我们采取了合理可行的技术安全和组织措施，以保护所收集到的与服务有关的个人信息，防止个人信息遭到未经授权的访问、公开披露、使用、修改、损坏或丢失。我们会采取一切合理可行的措施，保护您的个人信息，主要包括： /><（1） 我们使用 SSL/TLS等主流安全技术手段对许多服务以及传输通道进行加密。我们会定期审查信息收集、存储和处理方面的做法（包括物理性安全措施），以避免各种系统遭到未经授权的访问或篡改。 /><（2） 根据有关法规要求，我们任命了个人信息保护负责人并成立了个人信息保护工作机构。我们还建立了相关的内控管理流程，以最小授权为原则，我们对个人信息的访问进行严格的权限管控，只允许那些为了帮我们处理个人信息而需要知晓这些信息的我们的员工、授权代为处理的服务公司的人员访问个人信息，而且他们需要履行严格的合同保密义务，如果其未能履行这些义务，就可能会被追究法律责任或被终止其与我们的关系。个人数据的访问日志将被记录，并定期审计。针对需要访问敏感个人信息的员工，其访问权限由个人信息保护负责人或者相关管理人员审批，记录访问情况，并采取技术措施，避免违法访问、修改、复制、下载个人信息。 /><（3） 对我们来说，您的信息的安全非常重要。因此，我们将不断努力保障您的个人信息安全，并实施存储和传输全程安全加密等保障手段，以免您的信息在未经授权的情况下被访问、使用或披露。同时，某些加密数据的具体内容，除了用户自己，其他人都无权访问。 /><（4） 我们在传输和存储您的敏感个人信息或其他特殊类型个人信息时，会采用加密等安全措施；存储个人生物识别信息时，将采用技术措施处理后再进行存储，例如仅存储个人生物识别信息的摘要。 /><（5） 我们会严格筛选业务合作伙伴和服务提供商，将在个人信息保护方面的要求落实到双方的商务合同或审计、考核等活动中。 /><（6） 公司内部颁布实施数据安全管理规范，明确对用户数据（包括用户个人信息）的保护标准和要求。 /><（7） 我们会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程、测试与宣传活动，加强员工对于保护个人信息重要性的认识。 /><（8） 我们采用国际及业内认可的标准来保护您的个人信息，并积极通过相关安全与隐私保护认证，并与监管方、第三方安全服务提供商、测评认证机构建立良好的协调沟通机制，及时抵御并处置信息安全威胁，保护您的个人信息及隐私安全。 /><2、 个人信息安全事件的通知与应对 /><但是请注意，虽然我们采取了合理的措施保护您的信息，但没有任何网站、Internet 传输、计算机系统或无线连接是绝对安全的。 /><在发生个人信息安全事件后，我们将按照相关法律法规的要求，及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。我们将及时将事件相关情况以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式告知您。难以逐一告知个人信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报个人信息安全事件的处置情况，并采取措施降低由此产生的任何风险。 /><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。

/><2、 删除您的个人信息 /><有如下情形之一的，我们将主动删除您的个人信息，或您可以向我们提出删除请求： /><●  处理目的已实现、无法实现或者为实现处理目的不再必要； /><●  我们停止提供产品/服务，或者保存期限已届满，例如您已经不再使用我们的产品/服务； /><●  您已经撤回同意； /><●  我们违反法律、行政法规或者违反约定处理您的个人信息；

/><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。

/><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利

/><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。

/><●  位置信息（仅适用于特定产品/服务）：这可能包括当您访问一些基于位置的服务时(例如当您使用天气、指南针、定位服务等应用程序，或在拨打紧急电话时快速定位)，设备收集的模糊位置或精准位置相关的各类信息，例如国家/地区/城市及相关代码、移动网络代码、小区标识、经纬度信息。这些信息将通过GPS信号、WLAN或您附近的Wi-Fi接入点和基站的信息、设备位置 ID、网络服务提供商 ID获取。我们将询问您是否要为每个基于位置权限的应用程序启用基于位置权限的服务。您可以从设备设置中禁用设备的位置权限，拒绝提供您的位置信息。如果禁用位置权限，则基于位置信息向您提供服务的应用程序和功能可能会受到影响。 /><●  相机、相册：为了保证相机应用的正常运行，我们会收集操作数据（如您使用应用的次数、拍摄的照片数量）、拍摄的照片参数信息（如感光度、选择拍摄模式）以及您设备上剩余的可用空间信息。为提供图片的地点信息、使用地理位置水印、地理滤镜等涉及位置信息的功能，相机、相册将获取地理位置信息和位置权限，您可以随时在对应应用的设置中关闭。 /><●  语音转文本：我们部分应用支持语音转文本功能，如录音、便签、邮件、小布助手、小布指令等。如您使用相关功能，我们需要采集、使用您选择的音频文件、语音信息上传至我们或第三方合作伙伴的服务器以实现文本的转换。 /><●  提供推送、通知服务：当您开启通知推送、通知服务时，我们可能会收集您的设备识别码（IMEI或OpenID）、网络信息、设备信息、操作系统信息、通知栏状态，且需要调取您设备的推送权限。我们会使用上述信息以推送通知、短信、邮件等方式向您提供、推广我们及相关第三方的产品/服务，内容主要包括用户消息告知、应用程序更新和安装、新产品发布、安全验证、用户调研回访，以及向您提供您可能感兴趣的销售/促销信息、广告、商业活动等商业性信息。上述服务只会在符合适用法律要求、征得您的同意后发生。您可以在具体产品/服务场景下，通过短信、邮件或更改设备设置等方式来管理、控制相关推送、通知服务。

/><●  当您参与营销、运营推广相关活动：此类活动主要包括您参加抽奖、比赛，领取优惠券，参加我们自办或我们的业务合作伙伴主办的运营推广、促销、营销活动，填写问卷，或参与我们自办或业务合作伙伴主办的用户论坛或博客。您可能需要向我们提供有关个人信息，包括您的姓名、联系方式（如你所在的国家/地区/城市、收货地址、电子邮件、电话号码），以及与该等活动相关的其他个人信息。 /><●  当您关注我们的社交媒体帐户、或以任何其他方式与我们互动：我们可能会收集交流时机的详情及内容或其他因响应您的要求而产生的个人信息。我们收到的个人信息取决于您在订阅服务、社交网络的隐私设置。 /><●  订阅服务：当您使用我们的信息订阅服务，包括短信、邮件等形式，我们可能会收集您的姓名、电话号码、电子邮件地址和有关您如何与我们的促销通讯互动的信息（例如您是否打开了电子邮件、短信或是否点击了相关链接）。

/><●  当您选择帮助与反馈：您的反馈对于协助我们改进产品/服务非常重要。您可以在各产品/服务内选择“帮助与反馈”服务，为了便于在右上角“我的反馈”界面查询、显示您的历史反馈记录、历史反馈进展，并准确地诊断和定位您的问题，本应用可能需要获取您的设备信息，包括设备识别码（如IMEI/OpenID）、设备品牌、机型、和OS版本。当点击右下角进入“我要反馈”界面，您需填写反馈内容、选择反馈类型，并提供您的任意一种联系方式（如手机号码、QQ号码、和/或邮箱地址），以便我们后续就您反馈的内容与您取得进一步联系。您还可以自主选择是否上传错误日志报告、埋点信息，增加反馈内容附件（包括文字、图片、视频）。

/><●  位置信息（仅适用于特定产品/服务）：这可能包括当您访问一些基于位置的服务时(例如当您使用天气、指南针、定位服务等应用程序，或在拨打紧急电话时快速定位)，设备收集的模糊位置或精准位置相关的各类信息，例如国家/地区/城市及相关代码、移动网络代码、小区标识、经纬度信息。这些信息将通过GPS信号、WLAN或您附近的Wi-Fi接入点和基站的信息、设备位置 ID、网络服务提供商 ID获取。我们将询问您是否要为每个基于位置权限的应用程序启用基于位置权限的服务。您可以从设备设置中禁用设备的位置权限，拒绝提供您的位置信息。如果禁用位置权限，则基于位置信息向您提供服务的应用程序和功能可能会受到影响。 /><●  相机、相册：为了保证相机应用的正常运行，我们会收集操作数据（如您使用应用的次数、拍摄的照片数量）、拍摄的照片参数信息（如感光度、选择拍摄模式）以及您设备上剩余的可用空间信息。为提供图片的地点信息、使用地理位置水印、地理滤镜等涉及位置信息的功能，相机、相册将获取地理位置信息和位置权限，您可以随时在对应应用的设置中关闭。 /><●  语音转文本：我们部分应用支持语音转文本功能，如录音、便签、邮件、小布助手、小布指令等。如您使用相关功能，我们需要采集、使用您选择的音频文件、语音信息上传至我们或第三方合作伙伴的服务器以实现文本的转换。 /><●  提供推送、通知服务：当您开启通知推送、通知服务时，我们可能会收集您的设备识别码（IMEI或OpenID）、网络信息、设备信息、操作系统信息、通知栏状态，且需要调取您设备的推送权限。我们会使用上述信息以推送通知、短信、邮件等方式向您提供、推广我们及相关第三方的产品/服务，内容主要包括用户消息告知、应用程序更新和安装、新产品发布、安全验证、用户调研回访，以及向您提供您可能感兴趣的销售/促销信息、广告、商业活动等商业性信息。上述服务只会在符合适用法律要求、征得您的同意后发生。您可以在具体产品/服务场景下，通过短信、邮件或更改设备设置等方式来管理、控制相关推送、通知服务。

地址，和您的操作行为（包括修改密码、修改绑定的手机号码、邮箱号码、申诉记录），使用产品/服务的时间和持续时间、通过服务输入的搜索查询字词，软件的事件信息（包括重启、升级、错误、崩溃），并将上述内容作为日志进行记录。 /><●  有关您使用本服务的其他信息：这可能包括正在使用的应用程序版本或浏览器类型、语言设置、IP地址、设备类型、设备ID（如IMEI/SN码/OpenID）、访问的网站以及您如何与本服务提供的内容进行互动。 /><关于您访问我们的网站时，我们通过Cookies和其他类似技术自动收集的个人信息的进一步信息，请参见下文第三章“我们如何使用Cookies和其他同类技术”部分。 /><3、 我们间接收集的个人信息 /><在法律允许的情况下或在您的授权范围内，我们可能会从关联公司或第三方间接获取有关您的个人信息。例如我们可能会从公共或商业来源获得有关您的数据，包括您使用的社交网络的活动，并可能将其与从您处获得的或与您相关的其他信息相结合。 /><在我们从关联公司或第三方间接收集您的个人信息前，我们会要求第三方对个人信息来源的合法性、合规性以书面协议的形式作出承诺，如第三方有违反行为的，我们会明确要求对方承担相应的法律责任。例如： /><社交网络互动：您通过社交媒体网站或第三方服务与我们进行互动，例如您在微博上点赞、关注或共享与我们有关的内容。

/><为避免疑虑以及透明地告知您有关个人信息处理的信息，请注意，本条中列出的个人信息将仅在您的设备终端进行本地收集和处理，而不会上传至我们的服务器。因此，我们不会访问、收集或以其他方式处理该等个人信息和相关其他类别的信息，也无法向任何第三方披露相关信息或将其用于任何其他目的。这也意味着该个人信息和其他类别信息的处理仅由您在设备端完成，因此不受本政策的约束。如果您希望行使与该等个人信息相关的权利，或希望修改或删除相关个人信息，我们仅能提供关于您如何自行处理数据的信息。 /><●  面部和指纹识别:这些功能允许使用预先录制的面部或指纹信息快速解锁您的设备，例如设置锁屏密码，或进行需要识别面部、指纹信息的相关功能，例如智能通知隐藏等。要激活相关功能，您需要从不同的角度提供您的面部特征信息或指纹信息。这种类型的信息将使用唯一的密钥文件系统进行加密以使用其他安全措施。 /><●  照片搜索、分类：“相机”、“相册”等应用使用设备的本地图像和视频识别算法来为您提供照片和视频的组织分类功能，例如搜索、智能分类、精彩回忆、高光时刻等功能。当您搜索图片时，设备本地端算法将匹配与搜索词相关的照片，使您能够快速查看照片。

/><●  位置信息（仅适用于特定产品/服务）：这可能包括当您访问一些基于位置的服务时(例如当您使用天气、指南针、定位服务等应用程序，或在拨打紧急电话时快速定位)，设备收集的模糊位置或精准位置相关的各类信息，例如国家/地区/城市及相关代码、移动网络代码、小区标识、经纬度信息。这些信息将通过GPS信号、WLAN或您附近的Wi-Fi接入点和基站的信息、设备位置 ID、网络服务提供商 ID获取。我们将询问您是否要为每个基于位置权限的应用程序启用基于位置权限的服务。您可以从设备设置中禁用设备的位置权限，拒绝提供您的位置信息。如果禁用位置权限，则基于位置信息向您提供服务的应用程序和功能可能会受到影响。 /><●  相机、相册：为了保证相机应用的正常运行，我们会收集操作数据（如您使用应用的次数、拍摄的照片数量）、拍摄的照片参数信息（如感光度、选择拍摄模式）以及您设备上剩余的可用空间信息。为提供图片的地点信息、使用地理位置水印、地理滤镜等涉及位置信息的功能，相机、相册将获取地理位置信息和位置权限，您可以随时在对应应用的设置中关闭。 /><●  语音转文本：我们部分应用支持语音转文本功能，如录音、便签、邮件、小布助手、小布指令等。如您使用相关功能，我们需要采集、使用您选择的音频文件、语音信息上传至我们或第三方合作伙伴的服务器以实现文本的转换。 /><●  提供推送、通知服务：当您开启通知推送、通知服务时，我们可能会收集您的设备识别码（IMEI或OpenID）、网络信息、设备信息、操作系统信息、通知栏状态，且需要调取您设备的推送权限。我们会使用上述信息以推送通知、短信、邮件等方式向您提供、推广我们及相关第三方的产品/服务，内容主要包括用户消息告知、应用程序更新和安装、新产品发布、安全验证、用户调研回访，以及向您提供您可能感兴趣的销售/促销信息、广告、商业活动等商业性信息。上述服务只会在符合适用法律要求、征得您的同意后发生。您可以在具体产品/服务场景下，通过短信、邮件或更改设备设置等方式来管理、控制相关推送、通知服务。 /><●   /><欢太帐号注册、登录： /><部分应用支持欢太帐号注册、登录以提供更多功能，欢太帐号相关功能、服务由广东欢太科技有限公司提供。当您注册或登录欢太帐号时，为履行法定义务及履行合同所必要，您需要提供您的手机号码、邮箱、帐号密码或短信验证码，同时欢太帐号可能会使用您的出生日期来确定欢太帐号持有人的年龄以及确定适当的服务，关于更多帐号注册、登录涉及的个人信息保护详情，请您参阅

/><●  位置信息（仅适用于特定产品/服务）：这可能包括当您访问一些基于位置的服务时(例如当您使用天气、指南针、定位服务等应用程序，或在拨打紧急电话时快速定位)，设备收集的模糊位置或精准位置相关的各类信息，例如国家/地区/城市及相关代码、移动网络代码、小区标识、经纬度信息。这些信息将通过GPS信号、WLAN或您附近的Wi-Fi接入点和基站的信息、设备位置 ID、网络服务提供商 ID获取。我们将询问您是否要为每个基于位置权限的应用程序启用基于位置权限的服务。您可以从设备设置中禁用设备的位置权限，拒绝提供您的位置信息。如果禁用位置权限，则基于位置信息向您提供服务的应用程序和功能可能会受到影响。 /><●  相机、相册：为了保证相机应用的正常运行，我们会收集操作数据（如您使用应用的次数、拍摄的照片数量）、拍摄的照片参数信息（如感光度、选择拍摄模式）以及您设备上剩余的可用空间信息。为提供图片的地点信息、使用地理位置水印、地理滤镜等涉及位置信息的功能，相机、相册将获取地理位置信息和位置权限，您可以随时在对应应用的设置中关闭。

地址，和您的操作行为（包括修改密码、修改绑定的手机号码、邮箱号码、申诉记录），使用产品/服务的时间和持续时间、通过服务输入的搜索查询字词，软件的事件信息（包括重启、升级、错误、崩溃），并将上述内容作为日志进行记录。 /><●  有关您使用本服务的其他信息：这可能包括正在使用的应用程序版本或浏览器类型、语言设置、IP地址、设备类型、设备ID（如IMEI/SN码/OpenID）、访问的网站以及您如何与本服务提供的内容进行互动。 /><关于您访问我们的网站时，我们通过Cookies和其他类似技术自动收集的个人信息的进一步信息，请参见下文第三章“我们如何使用Cookies和其他同类技术”部分。 /><3、 我们间接收集的个人信息 /><在法律允许的情况下或在您的授权范围内，我们可能会从关联公司或第三方间接获取有关您的个人信息。例如我们可能会从公共或商业来源获得有关您的数据，包括您使用的社交网络的活动，并可能将其与从您处获得的或与您相关的其他信息相结合。 /><在我们从关联公司或第三方间接收集您的个人信息前，我们会要求第三方对个人信息来源的合法性、合规性以书面协议的形式作出承诺，如第三方有违反行为的，我们会明确要求对方承担相应的法律责任。例如： /><社交网络互动：您通过社交媒体网站或第三方服务与我们进行互动，例如您在微博上点赞、关注或共享与我们有关的内容。

/><为避免疑虑以及透明地告知您有关个人信息处理的信息，请注意，本条中列出的个人信息将仅在您的设备终端进行本地收集和处理，而不会上传至我们的服务器。因此，我们不会访问、收集或以其他方式处理该等个人信息和相关其他类别的信息，也无法向任何第三方披露相关信息或将其用于任何其他目的。这也意味着该个人信息和其他类别信息的处理仅由您在设备端完成，因此不受本政策的约束。如果您希望行使与该等个人信息相关的权利，或希望修改或删除相关个人信息，我们仅能提供关于您如何自行处理数据的信息。 /><●  面部和指纹识别:这些功能允许使用预先录制的面部或指纹信息快速解锁您的设备，例如设置锁屏密码，或进行需要识别面部、指纹信息的相关功能，例如智能通知隐藏等。要激活相关功能，您需要从不同的角度提供您的面部特征信息或指纹信息。这种类型的信息将使用唯一的密钥文件系统进行加密以使用其他安全措施。

/><●  当您参与营销、运营推广相关活动：此类活动主要包括您参加抽奖、比赛，领取优惠券，参加我们自办或我们的业务合作伙伴主办的运营推广、促销、营销活动，填写问卷，或参与我们自办或业务合作伙伴主办的用户论坛或博客。您可能需要向我们提供有关个人信息，包括您的姓名、联系方式（如你所在的国家/地区/城市、收货地址、电子邮件、电话号码），以及与该等活动相关的其他个人信息。 /><●  当您关注我们的社交媒体帐户、或以任何其他方式与我们互动：我们可能会收集交流时机的详情及内容或其他因响应您的要求而产生的个人信息。我们收到的个人信息取决于您在订阅服务、社交网络的隐私设置。 /><●  订阅服务：当您使用我们的信息订阅服务，包括短信、邮件等形式，我们可能会收集您的姓名、电话号码、电子邮件地址和有关您如何与我们的促销通讯互动的信息（例如您是否打开了电子邮件、短信或是否点击了相关链接）。 /><●  当您启用个性化推荐：如您启用个性化服务，选择内容推荐及个性化广告推荐服务，我们可能需要收集、使用您的设备信息（设备型号、软件OS版本、配置信息、SIM卡信息、IMSI信息）、设备识别码（例如IMEI/SN码/OpenID）、应用使用记录、IP地址、已安装应用列表、软件包名、设备连接信息（电信运营商、网络环境），以向您展示、推送更适合您的信息、商品、服务或广告等内容。同时，我们可能会将我们各类产品/服务中所收集的您的个人信息结合起来，以便整体而言为您提供更优化的产品服务体验。您可以在相应的产品/服务中对个性化推荐进行管理。 /><●  当您选择帮助与反馈：您的反馈对于协助我们改进产品/服务非常重要。您可以在各产品/服务内选择“帮助与反馈”服务，为了便于在右上角“我的反馈”界面查询、显示您的历史反馈记录、历史反馈进展，并准确地诊断和定位您的问题，本应用可能需要获取您的设备信息，包括设备识别码（如IMEI/OpenID）、设备品牌、机型、和OS版本。当点击右下角进入“我要反馈”界面，您需填写反馈内容、选择反馈类型，并提供您的任意一种联系方式（如手机号码、QQ号码、和/或邮箱地址），以便我们后续就您反馈的内容与您取得进一步联系。您还可以自主选择是否上传错误日志报告、埋点信息，增加反馈内容附件（包括文字、图片、视频）。 /><2、 我们自行收集的您使用我们产品/服务的个人信息 /><除了您主动提供的个人信息外，我们还可能会自行收集有关您使用我们产品/服务的相关信息，特别是在您的设备信息、您与产品/服务交互的信息。我们可能收集的个人信息包括： /><●  设备及SIM卡相关信息：这可能包括设备品牌和名称、设备型号、设备识别号（如IMEI/SN码/OpenID）、序列号、配置数据和状态（包括地区/语言/时区/字体设置、设备激活时间、设备输入时间、硬件基础配置信息）、SIM卡信息（如SIM 卡运营商、归属地）、操作系统OS软件版本、IMSI信息、ROM版本、设备使用数据（如CPU、内存、电量使用情况、设备分辨率、设备温度、相机镜头型号）、销售渠道以及用于访问服务设备的设置。 /><●  与您的应用程序使用相关的信息：应用内唯一标识符（如OpenID）、应用基础信息（如应用软件版本、应用列表、应用 ID 信息、SDK 版本）、应用设置数据（包括系统更新设置、地区/语言/时区/字体设置）、您在使用相关应用程序时产生的信息（如浏览记录、应用列表、使用历史记录、搜索关键词、输入内容）。 /><●  移动网络信息：这可能包括网络提供商 ID（PLMN）、地理位置（设备定位所在区域信号发射塔识别信息）、IP地址、MAC地址。 /><●  日志信息：与您使用某些功能、应用和网站相关的信息。这可能包括使用数据（包括进入/退出数据、服务的使用时间统计、产品升级统计），应用状态记录（应用安装、更新、卸载、错误日志），通过服务输入的搜索关键词，以及您设备的日志信息(例如访问IP、使用服务的时间和使用期限、使用服务时输入的搜索词，以及重启、升级、错误、崩溃等设备和软件事件的信息)。特别地，智能手机、平板和/或可穿戴设备等相关设备中的安卓系统的设计方式是，您的错误或崩溃日志会包含事件发生时收集的信息，以便我们分析崩溃原因。这些信息有时可能包括您的个人信息，如设备识别码、地理位置、电话号码、电子邮件地址、QQ。但是，我们已经实施了安全措施（如去标识化），以确保这些信息仅用于错误日志分析，而不是用于个人身份识别或其他目的。 /><●  位置信息（仅适用于特定产品/服务）：这可能包括当您访问一些基于位置的服务时(例如当您使用天气、指南针、定位服务等应用程序，或在拨打紧急电话时快速定位)，设备收集的模糊位置或精准位置相关的各类信息，例如国家/地区/城市及相关代码、移动网络代码、小区标识、经纬度信息。这些信息将通过GPS信号、WLAN或您附近的Wi-Fi接入点和基站的信息、设备位置 ID、网络服务提供商 ID获取。我们将询问您是否要为每个基于位置权限的应用程序启用基于位置权限的服务。您可以从设备设置中禁用设备的位置权限，拒绝提供您的位置信息。如果禁用位置权限，则基于位置信息向您提供服务的应用程序和功能可能会受到影响。 /><●  相机、相册：为了保证相机应用的正常运行，我们会收集操作数据（如您使用应用的次数、拍摄的照片数量）、拍摄的照片参数信息（如感光度、选择拍摄模式）以及您设备上剩余的可用空间信息。为提供图片的地点信息、使用地理位置水印、地理滤镜等涉及位置信息的功能，相机、相册将获取地理位置信息和位置权限，您可以随时在对应应用的设置中关闭。 /><●  语音转文本：我们部分应用支持语音转文本功能，如录音、便签、邮件、小布助手、小布指令等。如您使用相关功能，我们需要采集、使用您选择的音频文件、语音信息上传至我们或第三方合作伙伴的服务器以实现文本的转换。

/><我们会遵循按国家法律法规要求，恪守正当、合法、必要的原则保护您的个人信息，仅出于本政策所述的业务功能需要以及目的，并在征得您的同意下，收集、使用您的个人信息。您并非必须向我们提供个人信息，但在一些情况下，如果您选择不提供的信息，是提供相关产品/服务所必要的，将可能影响我们为您提供对应产品/服务，或回应、解决您所遇到的问题。我们收集个人信息的渠道主要包括：（1）您在使用产品/服务过程中主动提供的个人信息；（2）我们自行收集的您在接受相关产品/服务或使用功能过程中产生的个人信息；

/><●  当您参与营销、运营推广相关活动：此类活动主要包括您参加抽奖、比赛，领取优惠券，参加我们自办或我们的业务合作伙伴主办的运营推广、促销、营销活动，填写问卷，或参与我们自办或业务合作伙伴主办的用户论坛或博客。您可能需要向我们提供有关个人信息，包括您的姓名、联系方式（如你所在的国家/地区/城市、收货地址、电子邮件、电话号码），以及与该等活动相关的其他个人信息。 /><●  当您关注我们的社交媒体帐户、或以任何其他方式与我们互动：我们可能会收集交流时机的详情及内容或其他因响应您的要求而产生的个人信息。我们收到的个人信息取决于您在订阅服务、社交网络的隐私设置。 /><●  订阅服务：当您使用我们的信息订阅服务，包括短信、邮件等形式，我们可能会收集您的姓名、电话号码、电子邮件地址和有关您如何与我们的促销通讯互动的信息（例如您是否打开了电子邮件、短信或是否点击了相关链接）。 /><●  当您启用个性化推荐：如您启用个性化服务，选择内容推荐及个性化广告推荐服务，我们可能需要收集、使用您的设备信息（设备型号、软件OS版本、配置信息、SIM卡信息、IMSI信息）、设备识别码（例如IMEI/SN码/OpenID）、应用使用记录、IP地址、已安装应用列表、软件包名、设备连接信息（电信运营商、网络环境），以向您展示、推送更适合您的信息、商品、服务或广告等内容。同时，我们可能会将我们各类产品/服务中所收集的您的个人信息结合起来，以便整体而言为您提供更优化的产品服务体验。您可以在相应的产品/服务中对个性化推荐进行管理。 /><●  当您选择帮助与反馈：您的反馈对于协助我们改进产品/服务非常重要。您可以在各产品/服务内选择“帮助与反馈”服务，为了便于在右上角“我的反馈”界面查询、显示您的历史反馈记录、历史反馈进展，并准确地诊断和定位您的问题，本应用可能需要获取您的设备信息，包括设备识别码（如IMEI/OpenID）、设备品牌、机型、和OS版本。当点击右下角进入“我要反馈”界面，您需填写反馈内容、选择反馈类型，并提供您的任意一种联系方式（如手机号码、QQ号码、和/或邮箱地址），以便我们后续就您反馈的内容与您取得进一步联系。您还可以自主选择是否上传错误日志报告、埋点信息，增加反馈内容附件（包括文字、图片、视频）。 /><2、 我们自行收集的您使用我们产品/服务的个人信息 /><除了您主动提供的个人信息外，我们还可能会自行收集有关您使用我们产品/服务的相关信息，特别是在您的设备信息、您与产品/服务交互的信息。我们可能收集的个人信息包括： /><●  设备及SIM卡相关信息：这可能包括设备品牌和名称、设备型号、设备识别号（如IMEI/SN码/OpenID）、序列号、配置数据和状态（包括地区/语言/时区/字体设置、设备激活时间、设备输入时间、硬件基础配置信息）、SIM卡信息（如SIM 卡运营商、归属地）、操作系统OS软件版本、IMSI信息、ROM版本、设备使用数据（如CPU、内存、电量使用情况、设备分辨率、设备温度、相机镜头型号）、销售渠道以及用于访问服务设备的设置。 /><●  与您的应用程序使用相关的信息：应用内唯一标识符（如OpenID）、应用基础信息（如应用软件版本、应用列表、应用 ID 信息、SDK 版本）、应用设置数据（包括系统更新设置、地区/语言/时区/字体设置）、您在使用相关应用程序时产生的信息（如浏览记录、应用列表、使用历史记录、搜索关键词、输入内容）。 /><●  移动网络信息：这可能包括网络提供商 ID（PLMN）、地理位置（设备定位所在区域信号发射塔识别信息）、IP地址、MAC地址。 /><●  日志信息：与您使用某些功能、应用和网站相关的信息。这可能包括使用数据（包括进入/退出数据、服务的使用时间统计、产品升级统计），应用状态记录（应用安装、更新、卸载、错误日志），通过服务输入的搜索关键词，以及您设备的日志信息(例如访问IP、使用服务的时间和使用期限、使用服务时输入的搜索词，以及重启、升级、错误、崩溃等设备和软件事件的信息)。特别地，智能手机、平板和/或可穿戴设备等相关设备中的安卓系统的设计方式是，您的错误或崩溃日志会包含事件发生时收集的信息，以便我们分析崩溃原因。这些信息有时可能包括您的个人信息，如设备识别码、地理位置、电话号码、电子邮件地址、QQ。但是，我们已经实施了安全措施（如去标识化），以确保这些信息仅用于错误日志分析，而不是用于个人身份识别或其他目的。

/><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><2、 我们自行收集的您使用我们产品/服务的个人信息 /><除了您主动提供的个人信息外，我们还可能会自行收集有关您使用我们产品/服务的相关信息，特别是在您的设备信息、您与产品/服务交互的信息。我们可能收集的个人信息包括：

卡运营商、归属地）、操作系统OS软件版本、IMSI信息、ROM版本、设备使用数据（如CPU、内存、电量使用情况、设备分辨率、设备温度、相机镜头型号）、销售渠道以及用于访问服务设备的设置。 /><●  与您的应用程序使用相关的信息：应用内唯一标识符（如OpenID）、应用基础信息（如应用软件版本、应用列表、应用 ID 信息、SDK 版本）、应用设置数据（包括系统更新设置、地区/语言/时区/字体设置）、您在使用相关应用程序时产生的信息（如浏览记录、应用列表、使用历史记录、搜索关键词、输入内容）。 /><●  移动网络信息：这可能包括网络提供商 ID（PLMN）、地理位置（设备定位所在区域信号发射塔识别信息）、IP地址、MAC地址。

/><●  位置信息（仅适用于特定产品/服务）：这可能包括当您访问一些基于位置的服务时(例如当您使用天气、指南针、定位服务等应用程序，或在拨打紧急电话时快速定位)，设备收集的模糊位置或精准位置相关的各类信息，例如国家/地区/城市及相关代码、移动网络代码、小区标识、经纬度信息。这些信息将通过GPS信号、WLAN或您附近的Wi-Fi接入点和基站的信息、设备位置 ID、网络服务提供商 ID获取。我们将询问您是否要为每个基于位置权限的应用程序启用基于位置权限的服务。您可以从设备设置中禁用设备的位置权限，拒绝提供您的位置信息。如果禁用位置权限，则基于位置信息向您提供服务的应用程序和功能可能会受到影响。 /><●  相机、相册：为了保证相机应用的正常运行，我们会收集操作数据（如您使用应用的次数、拍摄的照片数量）、拍摄的照片参数信息（如感光度、选择拍摄模式）以及您设备上剩余的可用空间信息。为提供图片的地点信息、使用地理位置水印、地理滤镜等涉及位置信息的功能，相机、相册将获取地理位置信息和位置权限，您可以随时在对应应用的设置中关闭。

/><2、 我们自行收集的您使用我们产品/服务的个人信息 /><除了您主动提供的个人信息外，我们还可能会自行收集有关您使用我们产品/服务的相关信息，特别是在您的设备信息、您与产品/服务交互的信息。我们可能收集的个人信息包括：

卡运营商、归属地）、操作系统OS软件版本、IMSI信息、ROM版本、设备使用数据（如CPU、内存、电量使用情况、设备分辨率、设备温度、相机镜头型号）、销售渠道以及用于访问服务设备的设置。 /><●  与您的应用程序使用相关的信息：应用内唯一标识符（如OpenID）、应用基础信息（如应用软件版本、应用列表、应用 ID 信息、SDK 版本）、应用设置数据（包括系统更新设置、地区/语言/时区/字体设置）、您在使用相关应用程序时产生的信息（如浏览记录、应用列表、使用历史记录、搜索关键词、输入内容）。 /><●  移动网络信息：这可能包括网络提供商 ID（PLMN）、地理位置（设备定位所在区域信号发射塔识别信息）、IP地址、MAC地址。

/><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。

/><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务

/><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利 /><如用户不幸逝世，在该用户生前未通过书面或者其他合理方式向我们告知另有安排的前提下，该用户的近亲属可基于自身的合法、正当利益，与我们联系，以获取相关指引来行使法律规定的查阅、复制、更正、删除等权利。 /><7、 其他 /><退出用户体验计划：您可以随时通过设备的设置管理选择退出用户体验计划。在您选择退出该计划后，我们将不再收集、处理从您的设备上收集到的该计划的所有数据。

/><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份；不同的产品/服务、操作系统、产品软件的不同版本之间，操作设置可能存在差异；此外，为了优化您的使用体验，我们可能对具体操作设置进行调整。 /><您对您个人信息享有的权利如下： /><1、 查阅、更正、补充您的个人信息 /><(1) 查阅：您有权了解、查阅我们如何处理您的个人信息，以及您对您的个人信息有哪些选择和权利。为提高个人信息处理的透明度，我们发布了本政策，在特定的产品/服务中，您也可以通过查看相关产品/服务的弹窗、声明、补充政策。

/><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利

/><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利 /><如用户不幸逝世，在该用户生前未通过书面或者其他合理方式向我们告知另有安排的前提下，该用户的近亲属可基于自身的合法、正当利益，与我们联系，以获取相关指引来行使法律规定的查阅、复制、更正、删除等权利。 /><7、 其他 /><退出用户体验计划：您可以随时通过设备的设置管理选择退出用户体验计划。在您选择退出该计划后，我们将不再收集、处理从您的设备上收集到的该计划的所有数据。 /><约束信息系统自动决策：在某些产品/服务中，我们可能依据信息系统、算法等在内的非人工自动决策机制作出决定。如果这些决定显著影响您的合法权益，您可以联系我们。 /><退订营销、推送服务：如果您不希望再收到营销、推送信息，您可以随时通过每条促销短信、邮件中所述的方法或更改设备设置等方式来管理相关服务。 /><8、 响应您的上述请求 /><（1） 响应方式

/><如您对您的个人信息主体权利存在任何疑问、意见或建议的，或者要求我们对本政策进行解释说明，可以与我们取得联系。我们将及时向您进行解释。如果您对收到的答复不满意，您有权将投诉提交至相关监管部门。 /><（2） 响应时间 /><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

SSL/TLS等主流安全技术手段对许多服务以及传输通道进行加密。我们会定期审查信息收集、存储和处理方面的做法（包括物理性安全措施），以避免各种系统遭到未经授权的访问或篡改。 /><（2） 根据有关法规要求，我们任命了个人信息保护负责人并成立了个人信息保护工作机构。我们还建立了相关的内控管理流程，以最小授权为原则，我们对个人信息的访问进行严格的权限管控，只允许那些为了帮我们处理个人信息而需要知晓这些信息的我们的员工、授权代为处理的服务公司的人员访问个人信息，而且他们需要履行严格的合同保密义务，如果其未能履行这些义务，就可能会被追究法律责任或被终止其与我们的关系。个人数据的访问日志将被记录，并定期审计。针对需要访问敏感个人信息的员工，其访问权限由个人信息保护负责人或者相关管理人员审批，记录访问情况，并采取技术措施，避免违法访问、修改、复制、下载个人信息。 /><（3） 对我们来说，您的信息的安全非常重要。因此，我们将不断努力保障您的个人信息安全，并实施存储和传输全程安全加密等保障手段，以免您的信息在未经授权的情况下被访问、使用或披露。同时，某些加密数据的具体内容，除了用户自己，其他人都无权访问。 /><（4） 我们在传输和存储您的敏感个人信息或其他特殊类型个人信息时，会采用加密等安全措施；存储个人生物识别信息时，将采用技术措施处理后再进行存储，例如仅存储个人生物识别信息的摘要。 /><（5） 我们会严格筛选业务合作伙伴和服务提供商，将在个人信息保护方面的要求落实到双方的商务合同或审计、考核等活动中。 /><（6） 公司内部颁布实施数据安全管理规范，明确对用户数据（包括用户个人信息）的保护标准和要求。 /><（7） 我们会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程、测试与宣传活动，加强员工对于保护个人信息重要性的认识。 /><（8） 我们采用国际及业内认可的标准来保护您的个人信息，并积极通过相关安全与隐私保护认证，并与监管方、第三方安全服务提供商、测评认证机构建立良好的协调沟通机制，及时抵御并处置信息安全威胁，保护您的个人信息及隐私安全。 /><2、 个人信息安全事件的通知与应对 /><但是请注意，虽然我们采取了合理的措施保护您的信息，但没有任何网站、Internet 传输、计算机系统或无线连接是绝对安全的。 /><在发生个人信息安全事件后，我们将按照相关法律法规的要求，及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。我们将及时将事件相关情况以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式告知您。难以逐一告知个人信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报个人信息安全事件的处置情况，并采取措施降低由此产生的任何风险。 /><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份；不同的产品/服务、操作系统、产品软件的不同版本之间，操作设置可能存在差异；此外，为了优化您的使用体验，我们可能对具体操作设置进行调整。 /><您对您个人信息享有的权利如下： /><1、 查阅、更正、补充您的个人信息 /><(1) 查阅：您有权了解、查阅我们如何处理您的个人信息，以及您对您的个人信息有哪些选择和权利。为提高个人信息处理的透明度，我们发布了本政策，在特定的产品/服务中，您也可以通过查看相关产品/服务的弹窗、声明、补充政策。 /><(2) 更正、补充：如果您发现我们处理的关于您的个人信息不准确或不完整，您有权要求我们及时纠正，并在适当的情况下要求我们完成修正您的个人信息。对于您的部分个人信息，您可以在特定产品/服务的相关功能页面直接进行更正、修改。为了保证个人信息的质量，避免因个人信息不准确、不完整对您的个人权益造成不利影响，我们可能需要在您行使更正权、补充权前，对您的身份进行必要的核实工作。 /><2、 删除您的个人信息 /><有如下情形之一的，我们将主动删除您的个人信息，或您可以向我们提出删除请求： /><●  处理目的已实现、无法实现或者为实现处理目的不再必要； /><●  我们停止提供产品/服务，或者保存期限已届满，例如您已经不再使用我们的产品/服务； /><●  您已经撤回同意； /><●  我们违反法律、行政法规或者违反约定处理您的个人信息； /><●  法律、行政法规规定的其他情形。 /><另外，在特定的产品/服务中，您可以在相关功能页面直接删除。 /><我们将根据国家法律法规及监管的要求决定是否响应您的请求，若我们决定响应您的删除请求，除非法律法规或规范性文件另有规定，您的个人信息将被删除或匿名化处理。同时，我们还将通知从我们获得您的个人信息的实体，要求其及时删除或对相关个人信息做匿名化处理，除非法律法规另有规定，或这些实体获得您的独立授权。 /><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利 /><如用户不幸逝世，在该用户生前未通过书面或者其他合理方式向我们告知另有安排的前提下，该用户的近亲属可基于自身的合法、正当利益，与我们联系，以获取相关指引来行使法律规定的查阅、复制、更正、删除等权利。 /><7、 其他 /><退出用户体验计划：您可以随时通过设备的设置管理选择退出用户体验计划。在您选择退出该计划后，我们将不再收集、处理从您的设备上收集到的该计划的所有数据。 /><约束信息系统自动决策：在某些产品/服务中，我们可能依据信息系统、算法等在内的非人工自动决策机制作出决定。如果这些决定显著影响您的合法权益，您可以联系我们。 /><退订营销、推送服务：如果您不希望再收到营销、推送信息，您可以随时通过每条促销短信、邮件中所述的方法或更改设备设置等方式来管理相关服务。 /><8、 响应您的上述请求 /><（1） 响应方式 /><您可以通过以下方式进行相应的隐私设置： /><●  在设备设置中管理用户体验计划、稳定性计划、个性化推荐等； /><●  在设备设置中管理权限； /><●  在各个产品/服务中进行开启/关闭相应功能，通过点击“撤回个人信息保护政策的同意”进行个人信息保护政策管理 /><您可以通过以下方式与我们取得联系： /><●  通过本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式联系我们。 /><如您对您的个人信息主体权利存在任何疑问、意见或建议的，或者要求我们对本政策进行解释说明，可以与我们取得联系。我们将及时向您进行解释。如果您对收到的答复不满意，您有权将投诉提交至相关监管部门。 /><（2） 响应时间 /><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份；不同的产品/服务、操作系统、产品软件的不同版本之间，操作设置可能存在差异；此外，为了优化您的使用体验，我们可能对具体操作设置进行调整。 /><您对您个人信息享有的权利如下： /><1、 查阅、更正、补充您的个人信息 /><(1) 查阅：您有权了解、查阅我们如何处理您的个人信息，以及您对您的个人信息有哪些选择和权利。为提高个人信息处理的透明度，我们发布了本政策，在特定的产品/服务中，您也可以通过查看相关产品/服务的弹窗、声明、补充政策。 /><(2) 更正、补充：如果您发现我们处理的关于您的个人信息不准确或不完整，您有权要求我们及时纠正，并在适当的情况下要求我们完成修正您的个人信息。对于您的部分个人信息，您可以在特定产品/服务的相关功能页面直接进行更正、修改。为了保证个人信息的质量，避免因个人信息不准确、不完整对您的个人权益造成不利影响，我们可能需要在您行使更正权、补充权前，对您的身份进行必要的核实工作。 /><2、 删除您的个人信息 /><有如下情形之一的，我们将主动删除您的个人信息，或您可以向我们提出删除请求： /><●  处理目的已实现、无法实现或者为实现处理目的不再必要； /><●  我们停止提供产品/服务，或者保存期限已届满，例如您已经不再使用我们的产品/服务； /><●  您已经撤回同意； /><●  我们违反法律、行政法规或者违反约定处理您的个人信息； /><●  法律、行政法规规定的其他情形。 /><另外，在特定的产品/服务中，您可以在相关功能页面直接删除。 /><我们将根据国家法律法规及监管的要求决定是否响应您的请求，若我们决定响应您的删除请求，除非法律法规或规范性文件另有规定，您的个人信息将被删除或匿名化处理。同时，我们还将通知从我们获得您的个人信息的实体，要求其及时删除或对相关个人信息做匿名化处理，除非法律法规另有规定，或这些实体获得您的独立授权。 /><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利 /><如用户不幸逝世，在该用户生前未通过书面或者其他合理方式向我们告知另有安排的前提下，该用户的近亲属可基于自身的合法、正当利益，与我们联系，以获取相关指引来行使法律规定的查阅、复制、更正、删除等权利。 /><7、 其他 /><退出用户体验计划：您可以随时通过设备的设置管理选择退出用户体验计划。在您选择退出该计划后，我们将不再收集、处理从您的设备上收集到的该计划的所有数据。 /><约束信息系统自动决策：在某些产品/服务中，我们可能依据信息系统、算法等在内的非人工自动决策机制作出决定。如果这些决定显著影响您的合法权益，您可以联系我们。 /><退订营销、推送服务：如果您不希望再收到营销、推送信息，您可以随时通过每条促销短信、邮件中所述的方法或更改设备设置等方式来管理相关服务。 /><8、 响应您的上述请求 /><（1） 响应方式 /><您可以通过以下方式进行相应的隐私设置： /><●  在设备设置中管理用户体验计划、稳定性计划、个性化推荐等； /><●  在设备设置中管理权限； /><●  在各个产品/服务中进行开启/关闭相应功能，通过点击“撤回个人信息保护政策的同意”进行个人信息保护政策管理 /><您可以通过以下方式与我们取得联系： /><●  通过本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式联系我们。 /><如您对您的个人信息主体权利存在任何疑问、意见或建议的，或者要求我们对本政策进行解释说明，可以与我们取得联系。我们将及时向您进行解释。如果您对收到的答复不满意，您有权将投诉提交至相关监管部门。 /><（2） 响应时间 /><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务 /><本政策不适用于第三方提供的产品/服务。我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序等可能包含指向第三方网站、产品和服务的链接。这类链接不视为我们对链接内容的推荐或授权，您可以选择是否访问或接受第三方提供的网站、产品和服务。例如，官方网站上的“关注我们”功能将引导您访问我们在社交网络平台中的官方帐号（如微博、微信等），在那里您可以了解由我们发布的营销或促销信息。 /><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><我们提供的产品/服务中可能包含我们授权的合作伙伴提供的SDK插件。当您在特定产品/服务中使用该授权合作伙伴提供的相关服务，相关服务插件将收集和处理您的相关个人信息。为了最大程度保障您的信息安全，我们建议您在使用任何第三方SDK类服务前先行查看其隐私条款。为保障您的合法权益，如您发现这等SDK或其他类似的应用程序存在风险时，建议您立即终止相关操作并及时与我们取得联系。 /><您可以通过访问特定产品/服务项下的《第三方信息共享清单》以进一步了解我特定产品/服务中使用第三方SDK的情况。 /><（4） 其他信息共享场景 /><根据法律法规规定要求、法律程序、诉讼和/或公共机构和政府部门依法提出的要求，我们可能会在最小必要的范围内在下述情况中共享您的个人信息： /><●  遵守传票或其他法律程序、法律行动或政府机构的要求； /><●  当我们真诚地认为披露是遵守法律和执法部门的合理要求所必需时； /><●  保护和行使我们的合法索赔、权利和财产； /><●  保护您或他人的权利、财产或个人安全； /><●  检测、预防、调查并解决欺诈行为；以及 /><●  保护我们服务的安全或完整性，例如产品的未授权使用，对我们条款或政策的违反或其他有害或非法活动。 /><如果我们确定为了保护用户，或对于达成以上目的披露是合理必要的，我们也可能会披露关于您的信息。为避免疑问，在当地数据保护法律明确许可的范围内且仅限符合上述情况，我们才会在未经您同意的情况下收集、使用或共享您的个人信息。这可能包括向公共或政府机构提供信息、与第三方合作伙伴共享您的个人信息，以防止在我们产品内外所进行的欺诈、违规等其他有害行为。 /><3、 转让 /><我们不会将您的个人信息转让给任何公司、组织和个人，但以下情况除外： /><●  经您主动请求且符合国家有关部门规定的条件时，我们会向其他方转让转移您的个人信息； /><●  根据适用的法律法规、法律程序的要求、强制性的行政或司法要求所必需的情况进行提供； /><●  商业交易中如涉及合并、收购或破产清算或类似活动时，如涉及个人信息转让，我们会在有限但必要的范围内向适用的第三方转移或披露您的个人信息，并要求新的持有您个人信息的公司、组织继续受本政策的约束，否则我们将要求该公司、组织重新向您征求授权同意。如果不涉及个人信息转让，我们会对您进行充分告知，并将我们控制的所有个人信息删除或做匿名化处理。我们会通过协议或其他适当措施，要求上述第三方采取相当的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息。 /><4、 公开披露 /><我们仅会在以下情况下，公开披露您的个人信息： /><●  获得您的单独同意后，按您同意的披露方式披露您所指定的个人信息； /><●  在法律、法律程序、诉讼或政府主管部门强制性要求的情况下，我们可能会公开披露您的个人信息。在符合法律法规的前提下，当我们收到上述披露信息的请求时，我们会要求必须出具与之相应的法律文件，如传票或调查函。我们坚信，对于要求我们提供的信息，应该在法律允许的范围内尽可能保持透明。我们对所有的请求都进行了慎重的审查，以确保其具备合法依据，且仅限于执法部门因特定调查目的且有合法权利获取的数据。 /><在公布促销、比赛、抽奖结果等营销、运营推广相关活动中，我们会脱敏展示中奖者帐号名称、手机号码等信息。 /><请注意：您在使用相关产品/服务自愿发布甚至公开分享的信息，例如社交媒体帐号、平台等，可能会涉及您或他人的个人信息甚至敏感个人信息，如您的交易信息、联系方式、家庭住址，以及您在评价时选择上传包含个人信息的文字、图片或视频各种形式的信息。请您在使用相关产品/服务时更加谨慎地考虑，是否要发布甚至公开分享相关信息。一旦您进行了此等共享，即使您在相关产品/服务中删除了相关信息，也很难确保您所共享的信息在所有接受转发的产品/服务中被全部删除，相关信息仍然可能留存在公众可获知的领域，仍可由其他用户、与我们没有关联不受我们控制的第三方独立地缓存、复制或存储，或通过其他用户或相关第三方在公众可获知的领域保存。 /><六、 我们如何保护您的个人信息 /><1、 我们采取的安全保护措施 /><我们非常重视个人信息的安全，我们采取了合理可行的技术安全和组织措施，以保护所收集到的与服务有关的个人信息，防止个人信息遭到未经授权的访问、公开披露、使用、修改、损坏或丢失。我们会采取一切合理可行的措施，保护您的个人信息，主要包括： /><（1） 我们使用 SSL/TLS等主流安全技术手段对许多服务以及传输通道进行加密。我们会定期审查信息收集、存储和处理方面的做法（包括物理性安全措施），以避免各种系统遭到未经授权的访问或篡改。 /><（2） 根据有关法规要求，我们任命了个人信息保护负责人并成立了个人信息保护工作机构。我们还建立了相关的内控管理流程，以最小授权为原则，我们对个人信息的访问进行严格的权限管控，只允许那些为了帮我们处理个人信息而需要知晓这些信息的我们的员工、授权代为处理的服务公司的人员访问个人信息，而且他们需要履行严格的合同保密义务，如果其未能履行这些义务，就可能会被追究法律责任或被终止其与我们的关系。个人数据的访问日志将被记录，并定期审计。针对需要访问敏感个人信息的员工，其访问权限由个人信息保护负责人或者相关管理人员审批，记录访问情况，并采取技术措施，避免违法访问、修改、复制、下载个人信息。 /><（3） 对我们来说，您的信息的安全非常重要。因此，我们将不断努力保障您的个人信息安全，并实施存储和传输全程安全加密等保障手段，以免您的信息在未经授权的情况下被访问、使用或披露。同时，某些加密数据的具体内容，除了用户自己，其他人都无权访问。 /><（4） 我们在传输和存储您的敏感个人信息或其他特殊类型个人信息时，会采用加密等安全措施；存储个人生物识别信息时，将采用技术措施处理后再进行存储，例如仅存储个人生物识别信息的摘要。 /><（5） 我们会严格筛选业务合作伙伴和服务提供商，将在个人信息保护方面的要求落实到双方的商务合同或审计、考核等活动中。 /><（6） 公司内部颁布实施数据安全管理规范，明确对用户数据（包括用户个人信息）的保护标准和要求。 /><（7） 我们会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程、测试与宣传活动，加强员工对于保护个人信息重要性的认识。 /><（8） 我们采用国际及业内认可的标准来保护您的个人信息，并积极通过相关安全与隐私保护认证，并与监管方、第三方安全服务提供商、测评认证机构建立良好的协调沟通机制，及时抵御并处置信息安全威胁，保护您的个人信息及隐私安全。 /><2、 个人信息安全事件的通知与应对 /><但是请注意，虽然我们采取了合理的措施保护您的信息，但没有任何网站、Internet 传输、计算机系统或无线连接是绝对安全的。 /><在发生个人信息安全事件后，我们将按照相关法律法规的要求，及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。我们将及时将事件相关情况以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式告知您。难以逐一告知个人信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报个人信息安全事件的处置情况，并采取措施降低由此产生的任何风险。 /><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份；不同的产品/服务、操作系统、产品软件的不同版本之间，操作设置可能存在差异；此外，为了优化您的使用体验，我们可能对具体操作设置进行调整。 /><您对您个人信息享有的权利如下： /><1、 查阅、更正、补充您的个人信息 /><(1) 查阅：您有权了解、查阅我们如何处理您的个人信息，以及您对您的个人信息有哪些选择和权利。为提高个人信息处理的透明度，我们发布了本政策，在特定的产品/服务中，您也可以通过查看相关产品/服务的弹窗、声明、补充政策。 /><(2) 更正、补充：如果您发现我们处理的关于您的个人信息不准确或不完整，您有权要求我们及时纠正，并在适当的情况下要求我们完成修正您的个人信息。对于您的部分个人信息，您可以在特定产品/服务的相关功能页面直接进行更正、修改。为了保证个人信息的质量，避免因个人信息不准确、不完整对您的个人权益造成不利影响，我们可能需要在您行使更正权、补充权前，对您的身份进行必要的核实工作。 /><2、 删除您的个人信息 /><有如下情形之一的，我们将主动删除您的个人信息，或您可以向我们提出删除请求： /><●  处理目的已实现、无法实现或者为实现处理目的不再必要； /><●  我们停止提供产品/服务，或者保存期限已届满，例如您已经不再使用我们的产品/服务； /><●  您已经撤回同意； /><●  我们违反法律、行政法规或者违反约定处理您的个人信息； /><●  法律、行政法规规定的其他情形。 /><另外，在特定的产品/服务中，您可以在相关功能页面直接删除。 /><我们将根据国家法律法规及监管的要求决定是否响应您的请求，若我们决定响应您的删除请求，除非法律法规或规范性文件另有规定，您的个人信息将被删除或匿名化处理。同时，我们还将通知从我们获得您的个人信息的实体，要求其及时删除或对相关个人信息做匿名化处理，除非法律法规另有规定，或这些实体获得您的独立授权。 /><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。 /><4、 改变授权或撤回同意 /><每个业务功能需要一些基本的个人信息才能得以完成（见本政策 “一、我们如何收集您的个人信息”、“二、我们如何使用您的个人信息”部分）。您可以通过删除信息、管理设备权限设置、更改相关产品/功能设置页面、注销帐号等方式改变您授权我们继续收集、使用个人信息的范围或撤回您的授权。 /><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利 /><如用户不幸逝世，在该用户生前未通过书面或者其他合理方式向我们告知另有安排的前提下，该用户的近亲属可基于自身的合法、正当利益，与我们联系，以获取相关指引来行使法律规定的查阅、复制、更正、删除等权利。 /><7、 其他 /><退出用户体验计划：您可以随时通过设备的设置管理选择退出用户体验计划。在您选择退出该计划后，我们将不再收集、处理从您的设备上收集到的该计划的所有数据。 /><约束信息系统自动决策：在某些产品/服务中，我们可能依据信息系统、算法等在内的非人工自动决策机制作出决定。如果这些决定显著影响您的合法权益，您可以联系我们。 /><退订营销、推送服务：如果您不希望再收到营销、推送信息，您可以随时通过每条促销短信、邮件中所述的方法或更改设备设置等方式来管理相关服务。 /><8、 响应您的上述请求 /><（1） 响应方式

/><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务

/><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。 /><我们会尽商业上的合理努力去要求这些第三方对您的个人信息采取保护措施，但我们无法保证这些第三方一定会按照我们的要求采取保护措施。因此，我们强烈建议，您在使用前仔细阅读第三方的个人信息保护政策，了解第三方的隐私保护实践，以判断是否使用/继续使用该第三方服务。 /><十、 本政策的查阅与更新 /><1、 查阅本政策 /><您可以在我们的网站、产品、服务、应用程序内查阅本政策，其中网站链接为

/><1、 存储地点 /><我们依照法律法规的规定，将在中华人民共和国大陆地区（以下简称“境内”）运营过程中收集和产生的您的个人信息存储于境内的服务器。仅在以下情形，且在满足法律法规及监管部门的相关规定后，我们可能会向境外主体提供您的个人信息：（1）法律法规有明确规定；（2）另行获得您单独同意；（3）您使用的产品与/或服务本身涉及跨境，且您主动向境外提供个人信息。我们将严格要求接收方按照相关法律法规要求及本政策来处理您的个人信息 /><当满足上述向境外主体提供个人信息的条件后，我们将在个人信息跨境转移之前采取充分的安全措施（如加密、去标识化等），确保我们收集的个人信息按照本政策并遵守在该国家或地区当地存储数据的法律，以最终确保您的个人信息得到充分的保护。 /><2、 存储时间 /><除非法律要求或您另行授权同意更长的保存期限，否则我们只会在为您提供产品/服务之目的必需的最短时间内存储您的个人信息。在您主动要求相关产品/服务删除个人信息或相关产品/服务收集、使用的个人信息超出必要的存储期限后，我们会根据法律法规要求尽快对您的个人信息进行删除或匿名化处理，但法律法规另有规定的除外。如果法律要求我们存储您的个人信息超过这个期限，我们将在法律要求的期限结束后删除或匿名化该个人信息。 /><我们判断个人信息的必要存储期限主要依据以下标准：（1）处理个人信息的目的：个人信息处理所对应的业务目的是否已经或者无法实现，或者个人信息处理活动是否因业务变更、终止等原因而不再必要；（2）个人信息的数量、性质和敏感程度；（3）未经授权使用和披露您的个人信息所带来的潜在风险；（4）维护相应交易及业务记录，以应对您可能的查询或投诉；（3）保证我们为您提供服务的安全和质量；（4）法律或者行政法规对个人信息的保存期限另有规定。 /><如您在使用相关产品/服务过程中，存在严重违反法律法规、产品/服务协议、政策或规则等情形，您的违法、违约记录及相应的信用记录、个人信息，将在法律允许的最大范围内进行保存。 /><在我们因特殊原因停止运营我们的部分或全部产品/服务时，我们会提前向您告知并停止相关产品/服务的个人信息收集和处理活动，并在满足法律法规规定的最短保存期内，将我们所持有的与该产品/服务相关的个人信息进行删除或匿名化处理，除非法律法规另有规定。 /><五、 我们如何委托处理、共享、转让、公开披露您的个人信息 /><1、 委托处理 /><我们可能会委托我们的关联公司或合作的其他第三方代表我们来处理信息，以便为您提供更好的产品/服务，改善您的用户体验。例如我们的物流供应商、云服务提供商、数据存储设施、客户服务供应商、广告和营销服务供应商以及其他专业服务提供商为我们提供技术支持服务、客户支持服务等。 /><对于委托处理个人信息的场景，我们会根据法律法规规定通过书面协议、现场审计等方式要求受托合作方（公司、组织和个人）遵守严格的保密义务并采取有效的保密措施，要求其只能代表我们并根据我们的指示在委托范围内处理您的信息，而不得出于其自身利益使用您的信息。书面协议中会严格约定委托处理的目的、期限、处理方式、个人信息的种类、保护措施以及双方的权利和义务等，并对受托人的个人信息处理活动进行监督。 /><2、 共享信息 /><我们可能会与关联公司、合作伙伴等第三方共享您的个人信息，以便为了向您提供更完善、优质的产品/服务。在共享的场景下，双方分别对个人信息拥有独立控制权。我们仅会出于合法、正当、必要、特定、明确的目的共享您的个人信息，只会共享提供服务所必要的个人信息，并且将在法律法规明确要求下取得您的单独同意。相关第三方无权将共享的个人信息用于任何其他用途。我们会与第三方合作方签署数据保护协议，要求他们采取相关的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息，明确合作方对您的个人信息的保护责任和义务。 /><如果您拒绝我们的关联公司、合作方在提供服务时收集、使用为提供特定产品/服务所必需的个人信息，将可能导致您无法使用相关产品/服务中由该关联公司、合作方提供的部分。 /><除以下情形外和本政策另有约定外，我们不会与任何第三方共享您的个人信息： /><（1） 与关联公司的共享 /><为了向您提供更为完善和丰富的产品/服务，我们可能通过接口或线下传输不时向我们的关联公司合法共享必要的个人信息。我们只会共享必要的个人信息，且受本政策中声明目的的约束。 /><（2） 为实现产品/服务的功能向第三方服务提供商的共享 /><我们的产品/服务中部分服务内容由第三方服务提供商提供。为向您提供您选择的功能/服务，我们需要向第三方共享必要的个人信息。 /><针对特定产品/服务，您可以通过访问其项下的《第三方信息共享清单》详细了解我们在特定产品/服务中向第三方服务提供商共享个人信息的情况。 /><（3） 我们与第三方软件开发包（SDK）服务商的合作 /><我们提供的产品/服务中可能包含我们授权的合作伙伴提供的SDK插件。当您在特定产品/服务中使用该授权合作伙伴提供的相关服务，相关服务插件将收集和处理您的相关个人信息。为了最大程度保障您的信息安全，我们建议您在使用任何第三方SDK类服务前先行查看其隐私条款。为保障您的合法权益，如您发现这等SDK或其他类似的应用程序存在风险时，建议您立即终止相关操作并及时与我们取得联系。 /><您可以通过访问特定产品/服务项下的《第三方信息共享清单》以进一步了解我特定产品/服务中使用第三方SDK的情况。 /><（4） 其他信息共享场景 /><根据法律法规规定要求、法律程序、诉讼和/或公共机构和政府部门依法提出的要求，我们可能会在最小必要的范围内在下述情况中共享您的个人信息： /><●  遵守传票或其他法律程序、法律行动或政府机构的要求； /><●  当我们真诚地认为披露是遵守法律和执法部门的合理要求所必需时； /><●  保护和行使我们的合法索赔、权利和财产； /><●  保护您或他人的权利、财产或个人安全； /><●  检测、预防、调查并解决欺诈行为；以及 /><●  保护我们服务的安全或完整性，例如产品的未授权使用，对我们条款或政策的违反或其他有害或非法活动。 /><如果我们确定为了保护用户，或对于达成以上目的披露是合理必要的，我们也可能会披露关于您的信息。为避免疑问，在当地数据保护法律明确许可的范围内且仅限符合上述情况，我们才会在未经您同意的情况下收集、使用或共享您的个人信息。这可能包括向公共或政府机构提供信息、与第三方合作伙伴共享您的个人信息，以防止在我们产品内外所进行的欺诈、违规等其他有害行为。 /><3、 转让 /><我们不会将您的个人信息转让给任何公司、组织和个人，但以下情况除外： /><●  经您主动请求且符合国家有关部门规定的条件时，我们会向其他方转让转移您的个人信息； /><●  根据适用的法律法规、法律程序的要求、强制性的行政或司法要求所必需的情况进行提供； /><●  商业交易中如涉及合并、收购或破产清算或类似活动时，如涉及个人信息转让，我们会在有限但必要的范围内向适用的第三方转移或披露您的个人信息，并要求新的持有您个人信息的公司、组织继续受本政策的约束，否则我们将要求该公司、组织重新向您征求授权同意。如果不涉及个人信息转让，我们会对您进行充分告知，并将我们控制的所有个人信息删除或做匿名化处理。我们会通过协议或其他适当措施，要求上述第三方采取相当的保密和安全措施来处理个人信息。 /><4、 公开披露 /><我们仅会在以下情况下，公开披露您的个人信息： /><●  获得您的单独同意后，按您同意的披露方式披露您所指定的个人信息； /><●  在法律、法律程序、诉讼或政府主管部门强制性要求的情况下，我们可能会公开披露您的个人信息。在符合法律法规的前提下，当我们收到上述披露信息的请求时，我们会要求必须出具与之相应的法律文件，如传票或调查函。我们坚信，对于要求我们提供的信息，应该在法律允许的范围内尽可能保持透明。我们对所有的请求都进行了慎重的审查，以确保其具备合法依据，且仅限于执法部门因特定调查目的且有合法权利获取的数据。 /><在公布促销、比赛、抽奖结果等营销、运营推广相关活动中，我们会脱敏展示中奖者帐号名称、手机号码等信息。 /><请注意：您在使用相关产品/服务自愿发布甚至公开分享的信息，例如社交媒体帐号、平台等，可能会涉及您或他人的个人信息甚至敏感个人信息，如您的交易信息、联系方式、家庭住址，以及您在评价时选择上传包含个人信息的文字、图片或视频各种形式的信息。请您在使用相关产品/服务时更加谨慎地考虑，是否要发布甚至公开分享相关信息。一旦您进行了此等共享，即使您在相关产品/服务中删除了相关信息，也很难确保您所共享的信息在所有接受转发的产品/服务中被全部删除，相关信息仍然可能留存在公众可获知的领域，仍可由其他用户、与我们没有关联不受我们控制的第三方独立地缓存、复制或存储，或通过其他用户或相关第三方在公众可获知的领域保存。 /><六、 我们如何保护您的个人信息 /><1、 我们采取的安全保护措施 /><我们非常重视个人信息的安全，我们采取了合理可行的技术安全和组织措施，以保护所收集到的与服务有关的个人信息，防止个人信息遭到未经授权的访问、公开披露、使用、修改、损坏或丢失。我们会采取一切合理可行的措施，保护您的个人信息，主要包括： /><（1） 我们使用 SSL/TLS等主流安全技术手段对许多服务以及传输通道进行加密。我们会定期审查信息收集、存储和处理方面的做法（包括物理性安全措施），以避免各种系统遭到未经授权的访问或篡改。 /><（2） 根据有关法规要求，我们任命了个人信息保护负责人并成立了个人信息保护工作机构。我们还建立了相关的内控管理流程，以最小授权为原则，我们对个人信息的访问进行严格的权限管控，只允许那些为了帮我们处理个人信息而需要知晓这些信息的我们的员工、授权代为处理的服务公司的人员访问个人信息，而且他们需要履行严格的合同保密义务，如果其未能履行这些义务，就可能会被追究法律责任或被终止其与我们的关系。个人数据的访问日志将被记录，并定期审计。针对需要访问敏感个人信息的员工，其访问权限由个人信息保护负责人或者相关管理人员审批，记录访问情况，并采取技术措施，避免违法访问、修改、复制、下载个人信息。 /><（3） 对我们来说，您的信息的安全非常重要。因此，我们将不断努力保障您的个人信息安全，并实施存储和传输全程安全加密等保障手段，以免您的信息在未经授权的情况下被访问、使用或披露。同时，某些加密数据的具体内容，除了用户自己，其他人都无权访问。 /><（4） 我们在传输和存储您的敏感个人信息或其他特殊类型个人信息时，会采用加密等安全措施；存储个人生物识别信息时，将采用技术措施处理后再进行存储，例如仅存储个人生物识别信息的摘要。 /><（5） 我们会严格筛选业务合作伙伴和服务提供商，将在个人信息保护方面的要求落实到双方的商务合同或审计、考核等活动中。 /><（6） 公司内部颁布实施数据安全管理规范，明确对用户数据（包括用户个人信息）的保护标准和要求。 /><（7） 我们会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程、测试与宣传活动，加强员工对于保护个人信息重要性的认识。 /><（8） 我们采用国际及业内认可的标准来保护您的个人信息，并积极通过相关安全与隐私保护认证，并与监管方、第三方安全服务提供商、测评认证机构建立良好的协调沟通机制，及时抵御并处置信息安全威胁，保护您的个人信息及隐私安全。 /><2、 个人信息安全事件的通知与应对 /><但是请注意，虽然我们采取了合理的措施保护您的信息，但没有任何网站、Internet 传输、计算机系统或无线连接是绝对安全的。 /><在发生个人信息安全事件后，我们将按照相关法律法规的要求，及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。我们将及时将事件相关情况以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式告知您。难以逐一告知个人信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报个人信息安全事件的处置情况，并采取措施降低由此产生的任何风险。 /><七、 您如何实现您作为个人信息主体的权利 /><我们尊重您对您个人信息的权利，并全力保护您对您个人信息的控制权。为此，我们为您提供多种方式方便您更安心、更便捷地进行隐私设置及个人信息管理，保障您的个人信息安全。以下列出您依法享有的权利，以及我们将如何保护您的这些权利。 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份；不同的产品/服务、操作系统、产品软件的不同版本之间，操作设置可能存在差异；此外，为了优化您的使用体验，我们可能对具体操作设置进行调整。 /><您对您个人信息享有的权利如下： /><1、 查阅、更正、补充您的个人信息 /><(1) 查阅：您有权了解、查阅我们如何处理您的个人信息，以及您对您的个人信息有哪些选择和权利。为提高个人信息处理的透明度，我们发布了本政策，在特定的产品/服务中，您也可以通过查看相关产品/服务的弹窗、声明、补充政策。 /><(2) 更正、补充：如果您发现我们处理的关于您的个人信息不准确或不完整，您有权要求我们及时纠正，并在适当的情况下要求我们完成修正您的个人信息。对于您的部分个人信息，您可以在特定产品/服务的相关功能页面直接进行更正、修改。为了保证个人信息的质量，避免因个人信息不准确、不完整对您的个人权益造成不利影响，我们可能需要在您行使更正权、补充权前，对您的身份进行必要的核实工作。 /><2、 删除您的个人信息 /><有如下情形之一的，我们将主动删除您的个人信息，或您可以向我们提出删除请求： /><●  处理目的已实现、无法实现或者为实现处理目的不再必要； /><●  我们停止提供产品/服务，或者保存期限已届满，例如您已经不再使用我们的产品/服务； /><●  您已经撤回同意； /><●  我们违反法律、行政法规或者违反约定处理您的个人信息；

/><请您理解，当您要求对您的信息进行删除或匿名化处理，如因适用法律和安全技术限制，我们可能无法立即从系统中删除，我们将安全地存储您的个人信息并限制对其的任何进一步的处理，直到可以删除或实现匿名化。 /><3、 复制、转移您的个人信息 /><您有权复制、转移您的个人信息。 /><在符合国家有关部门规定条件的前提下，如您请求将您的个人信息转移至您指定的个人信息处理者处，我们将实现该转移。

/><请注意，若您收回您的授权同意，可能导致我们将无法继续为您提供基于原同意、原授权所对应的产品/服务。同时，我们将不再处理相应的个人信息，但您撤回同意的决定，不会影响此前基于您的授权而开展的个人信息处理。 /><5、 投诉权 /><您有权通过本政策中披露的方式联系我们并进行投诉。如果您对我们的答复不满意，特别是我们的个人信息处理行为损害了您的合法权益，您还可以向网信、公安、工商等监管部门进行投诉或举报，或向有管辖权法院提起诉讼。 /><6、 逝者近亲属的权利

/><在符合相关法律规定且技术可行的前提下，我们会竭尽全力在收到您的请求后15个工作日内验证您的身份并完成处理响应。考虑到个人请求的复杂性和数量、技术实现的可行性，在必要的时候，这一期限可能延长。对于延期提供信息的情况，我们将通知个人信息主体相关情形和延迟原因。如果本段所设定的时限与相关法律法规发生冲突，则以相关法律法规的规定为准。 /><（3） 其他 /><请注意，出于安全考虑，在处理您的请求前，我们可能验证您的身份。 /><对于您合理的请求，我们原则上不收取费用。但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（例如，需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者非常不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝并在答复中向您具体说明理由。 /><此外，如果有法律、行政法规规定应当保密或者不需要告知的情形的，或者您的请求妨碍国家机关履行法定职责，直接涉及国家安全、国防安全、公共卫生、犯罪侦查等和公共利益直接相关的事由，或者可能导致您或者其他个人、组织的合法权益受到严重损害，我们可能无法响应您的请求。 /><八、 我们如何保护未成年人的个人信息 /><我们非常重视对未成年人个人信息保护的义务与责任，努力为未成年人营造健康的网络环境，并予以未成年人特别的保护。 /><我们所提供的大部分产品/服务主要面向成人，并不以儿童（不满14周岁的未成年人）为服务对象，我们不直接向儿童提供服务。请您留意，由于技术条件等客观限制，我们的产品/服务可能无法主动识别用户的年龄。 /><如果您是儿童，在使用相关产品/服务前，应事先征得您父母或其他监护人的同意，并务必和您的父母或其他监护人一起仔细阅读本政策，未经儿童父母及其他监护人同意，儿童不得使用我们的产品/服务。 /><督促儿童正确使用我们的产品/服务是父母及其他监护人的责任。如果您是儿童的父母或其他监护人，我们希望您与我们携手，共同保护儿童的个人信息，提高儿童增强个人信息保护意识和能力。您应确保儿童是在您的同意和引导协助之下使用我们的产品/服务。您在引导协助儿童使用我们的产品/服务之前，应和儿童共同仔细阅读本政策。 /><对于经父母或其他监护人同意而收集、处理儿童个人信息的情况，我们只会在受到法律允许、父母或其他监护人明确同意或者保护儿童所必要的情况下收集、使用相关个人信息。当我们发现在未事先获得可证实的父母或其他监护人同意的情况下收集到儿童个人信息时，我们会尽快删除相关数据。 /><我们不会主动收集、存储、使用、转移、披露儿童的个人信息，更不会将儿童的个人信息用于营销目的。如果您是儿童的家长或其他监护人，或您通过其他方式发现我们处理的信息中可能包括儿童的个人信息，请按照本政策第十一章“联系我们”提供的联系方式与我们联系，我们会设法尽快删除相关数据。 /><九、 第三方服务提供商及其服务

/><请您注意，您通过我们产品/服务的跳转功能访问的第三方网站经营者、接入的第三方服务提供方有自己的个人信息保护政策；当您查看第三方创建的网页或使用第三方开发的应用程序时，这些第三方可能会获取、使用您的个人信息。我们对此类第三方无控制权，相关个人信息的获取、使用不受我们的控制及本政策的约束，我们也无法对其隐私保护政策以及个人信息处理的行为承担任何责任或义务。
